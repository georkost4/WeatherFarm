Before doing anything  you must get an API key from this site https://agromonitoring.com/. Once you have the key open the file "sensitive_data" and put there your API_KEY.
After putting your api key you are good to go.

The logic of the app is this . It's a weather app whith the ability to draw polygons on the map and get forecast info for that polygons specifically. Once you open
the map fragment you can select 4 points on the map by long touching each position.  Carefull for not tangling the markers and create a messed 4 points polygon. Try
to draw a rectangle. You can choose a place to get weather forecast from settings menu.
